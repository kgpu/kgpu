# Wgpuj
Java bindings for [Wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) based on
[Wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native). 

This module is written in Java and has the FFI code for kgpu. It uses the [jnr-ffi](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-ffi) library,
which creates JNI bindings at runtime. Most of the code in this module is generated by jnr-gen

### Requirements:
- Rust 
- Java JDK 11+

### Old Version:
There is an archived version of this library at
 [kgpu/wgpu-java](https://github.com/kgpu/wgpu-java)

### How to add to Gradle (Kotlin DSL)
First you need to add the snapshots repository:
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven(url = "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/")
}
```

Then you can add the dependency:
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("io.github.kgpu:wgpuj:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT")
}
```
